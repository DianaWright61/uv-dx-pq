This FHIR implementation guide addresses needs of the biopharmaceutical industry for internal and external Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) data exchange. It defines a universal realm specification for the creation and exchange of CMC data internationally within biopharmaceutical companies and between a company and its stakeholders so that CMC content can be reused throughout the medicinal product lifecycle. 

The CMC topic domain describes how a medicinal product is manufactured, by whom, and at which manufacturing site in the world. Although not always visible to the healthcare system, CMC is applicable to the entire medicinal product lifecycle. Examples include the quality of drugs in clinical studies and the quality of the commercial drug available to consumers. Use of CMC data is essential to tracing adverse events back to the manufacturer and manufacturing site responsible for the medicinal product. CMC data are also important for management of drug supplies to avoid shortages.

This IG is developed for the Data Exchange Industry – Pharmaceutical Quality (dx-PQ) project 
* [Project Proposal: PSS-2137](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/PSS-2137)
* [Project Scope Statement: PSS-2145](https://jira.hl7.org/browse/PSS-2145)

### Relation to Other Standards
This project aligns with BR&R’s PQ/CMC project where possible.

### Technical Overview
This implementation guide is based upon **FHIR version 5.0.0** and is a Universal Realm Specification.

### Audience
This guide is primarily meant for developers of structured content authoring solutions, medicinal product manufacturers who produce CMC data, and those involved in pharmacovigilance analysis. Business analysts and policy managers can also benefit from the descriptions of the CMC data model provided in this guide.
